```
$ pip install pygame
```
if pip is not installed by default :
```
$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip
$ sudo apt-get update
```
* The game have to be creative and must not be an imitation of an other game.

### game-play
* The game can be single player or multiplayer.( but creating a LAN network for your game could take too time so we advise to make a multiplayer game local to your machine, ex : 2 layer playing on the same keyboard)
* There is no need to implement I.A in the game.( as you will not have enough time to implement it )
* The game must contain at least one character or object movable by player.
* All kind of input/output can be use but we cannot guarantee the availability of the materials.( for example we cannot give you micros or cameras )
* There is no need to give a main menu with options to change the game parameters. When the script is lunch the game can directly begin.


### Layout
* The game must use at least one of the tile sets provided ( or if it is one find on the web it has to be an open source one ).
* The map don't need to follow the player displacement.
